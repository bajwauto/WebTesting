# WebTesting
This project is meant for learning the basics of Web UI automation testing using the Selenium API.

Note:
1. Please check the gitignore to know about the excluded files and folders.
2. If you run the code locally, you need to create a log folder(name mentioned in the gitignore file). Other folders will get created automatically on running the tests.
3. Before running the tests, please do check the testng.xml file for the configurable parameters for capturing screenshots, generating extent reports, running tests using Selenium Grid etc.
