# WebTesting
This project is meant for learning the basics of Web UI automation testing using the Selenium API.

Note:
1. Please check the gitignore to know about the excluded files and folders.
2. If you run the code locally, you need to create a log folder(name mentioned in the gitignore file). Other folders will get created automatically on running the tests.
